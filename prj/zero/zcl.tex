\section{Introduction}

Polymer is a kind of system with many complex phase transitions
\cite{LifshitzRMP78,PrivmanBook81,ChengBook08,deGennesBook79,PhysRep},
such as the collapse transition\cite{FloryJCP49,
FloryBOOK67,WilliamsARPC81,OYJCP08}, the glass transition\cite{GibbsJCP58,
JackleRPP86}, and so on. These transitions generally are the results
of the interplay between the complex interaction and conformational
entropy, and have attracted a lot of physical interests
\cite{LifshitzRMP78,FloryJCP49,FloryBOOK67,WilliamsARPC81,GibbsJCP58,
JackleRPP86,deGennesBook79,StephenPLA75,RigByJCP1987,BellRMP93,
ChengARMR,PrivmanBook81,ZivPCCP09,ChengBook08,PCCP10,JCP09,JCP09b,JCP10,
PRL95,PhysRep,OYJCP08,BinderBook95}.

The adsorption transition of a single homopolymer to a certain interface
is a typical and fundamental example of the transitions in polymeric
systems\cite{LifshitzRMP78,deGennesBook79,ChengBook08,PhysRep,PCCP10,
JCP09,JCP09b,JCP10,PRL95,BinderBook95}.
At the high temperature or having a weak attraction with the interface,
a homopolymer would be free with globule-like conformations. This kind
of state (or phase) has large conformational and translational entropy.
Differently, at low temperatures or with a strong attraction, the polymer
chain would be adsorb on the interface with a relatively extended
conformations. These conformations are generally the results of the
nonspecific attractive interactions between monomers and the surface.
The transition between the free and the adsorbed states of homopolymers
following the changes of temperatures or affinity to the interface is
defined as the adsorption transition. The transition condition generally
marks the balance of the energy and the entropy of the system.
The adsorption transition have been studied for a long time with theoretical
and computational methods \cite{deGennesBook79,BinderBook95,CaparicaCPC09,
BinderBook10,PhysRep,PCCP10,JCP09,JCP09b,JCP10,PRL95},
and has become the basic problem in polymer
physics\cite{LifshitzRMP78,deGennesBook79,ChengBook08}
and other interdiscipline studies\cite{BiaoZi} (such as peptide adhesion and so on).

Recently, there are some more progresses in studying the adsorption
transitions. Complex phase structures related to adsorption are observed
\cite{PhysRep,PCCP10,JCP08}.
Especially, the size-dependent cooperativity in the adsorption processes
are pointed out in several works\cite{PCCP10,JCP09,JCP09b}. For short
polymer chains, the transition would be first-order-like, while for rather
long chains, the transition would behave asymptotically towards the classical
second-order transitions. The features of the transition could also affected
by the external perturbations\cite{Pull09}. Therefore,
The finite-size effect of the adsorption transition would be an interesting
direction, and may be helpful for a deeper comprehension for the
interface-related biological and engineering phenomena.

In this work, we employ the method of partition function zeros
to analyze the adsorption transitions of a series of two-dimensional
model polymers to an adhesive edge in square lattice. Full enumerations
of the conformations enables a precise determination of various
physical quantities. The size effect of the order of transitions,
the transition temperature, as well as the asymptotic exponent are
determined. The size effect of the order of the transition are also
discussed based on the information of zeros. These results give out a
systematic characterization of the adsorption transition for 2-d
lattice polymers.

%\section{Models and Methods}

%\subsection{Lattice models of polymers}

The lattice polymer is modeled as a two-dimensional self-avoided chain
on the square lattice. This kind of model is popular and simple to study
the physics of polymer systems. The length $L$ is defined as the number of the
monomers in the chain. For this kind of model of polymers, the position
of the monomer $i$ is ${\mathbf r}_i=(x_i,y_i)$ relative to the presumed
origin, where $x_i$ and $y_i$ are integers. The bonds of chain connect
the monomers with the neighboring indices and have the length of unit,
namely $|{\mathbf r}_{i+1}-{\mathbf r}_i|=1$. The exclusive volume effect
prohibits the overlaps of the chain, that is, there are no monomers sharing
the same coordinates, ${\mathbf r}_i\neq {\mathbf r}_j$ for $i\neq j$.
As a simplification, there are no interactions between monomers, which
describes the condition of good solvent.

The adsorption interface is mimicked with an edge in 2-d cases. The edge
is located at the position $y_e=-1$. All the monomers cannot penetrate
over the edge, that is, $y_i>y_e$ is required due to the exclusive volume
effect. The monomers neighboring to the edge (namely $y_i=0$) would have
an energy gain $-\epsilon<0$ as the attraction. This kind of interaction
corresponds to the cases with short-range attractive interactions.
As a result, the Hamiltonian of the system thus takes the form,
${\mathcal H}=-\sum_i \epsilon \delta(y_i)\Theta(y_i) =-\epsilon K$,
where the function $\delta(x)=1$ when $x=0$ and zero otherwise, the
function $\Theta(x)=1$ when $x\ge 0$ and is infinite otherwise, and the
integer $K$ is the number of contacts with the edge, which marks the
energy level of system. Generally, the quantity $\epsilon$ is picked
as the unit of energy, namely $\epsilon=1$.
To keep the system with a finite concentration, a fixed boundary
is located as the position $y_u$. In this work, we take $y_u=30$
which is apparently larger than the size of polymers, and would
not introduce unexpected boundary effects.
It is worth pointing out that the complex arrangement of the polymer
in the interface is suppressed for the two-dimensional cases. This
avoids the complexity related to the crystallization of polymer on
the interface, and helps us concentrate into the the adsorption
transition.

For this kind of interaction, the partition function of the system would be
expressed as a polynomial,
\begin{equation}
Z=\sum_{K=0}^{K_{\text{max}}} \Omega(K) s^K \, ,
\end{equation}
where the quantity $s=exp(\epsilon/T)=exp(\beta\epsilon)$, $\Omega(K)$ is
the density of states (DOS) of the system and records the number
of conformations on the energy level $K$ and $K_{\text{max}}$ is the
maximum of the index $K$. When the DOS is obtained, the partition function
and the related thermodynamic functions could be determined easily.

In this work, the DOS of the lattice polymers with various lengths are
determined with enumerations. Practically, a conformation is represented
as a string of directions. All the direction strings are enumerated.
Due to the existence of the edge, shift operations along the $y$ direction
are used to generate all possible conformations. Only the conformations
not overlapping with the edges
are recorded. It is worth noting the conformations which share a same
direction string after the rotation and/or reflection operations are not
regarded as the same conformation since the boundary eliminates the
symmetry of the system, which is different from the previous lattice
enumerations \cite{CieplakPRL98,PandePRL96}.

%\subsection{Partition Function Zeros}

The zeros of partition function $Z$ are defined as the roots $\beta_i=1/T$
for the equation $Z(\beta)=\sum_E n(E)e^{-\beta E}$ in the complex plane.
Here the index $i$ is assigned based on the distances of the zeros away
from the real axis (generally in upper or lower complex plane respectively).
For the systems with discrete levels, the equation $Z(s)=0$ would become
a polynomial equation, and is easy to solve. The expected solutions of
$\beta$ could be obtained with the transformation $\beta=-\ln s/\epsilon$.
These roots are tightly related to the phase transition
of the system described with the partition function $Z$ by Yang and Lee
\cite{LYPR52}, and Fisher\cite{FisherBook}. This offers a powerful method
to determine the properties of the phase transitions, and has been used
in critical phenomena\cite{LipowskiIJMPB05}, the homopolymer collapse
\cite{JCP10b}, the helix-coil transition
\cite{HansmannPRL00,HansmannPA01}, and the folding transition of
proteins and heteropolymers\cite{WangJCP03,ChenPA05}.
In this work, we apply this method to investigate
the adsorption transition of homopolymer systems.

Clearly, when $\beta_0=\beta_c=1/T_c$ is a root of the equation $Z(\beta_c)=0$,
all the thermodynamic potentials would be divergent at the temperature $T_c$.
If $T_c$ is a positive real number, this kind of divergence indicates a phase
transition with the discontinuity of thermodynamic potentials. For the systems
with finite size, there are generally no real roots for the equation $Z=0$.
If the locus of the zeros close to the real axis could intersect with the
real axis when $L\rightarrow\infty$, the system would have a phase transition
at the thermodynamic limit. Therefore, the zeros close to the real axis and
the trends of the zeros to approach to the real axis would bring us a lot of
information about the transitions. This establishes a paradigm to analysis
phase transitions based on the models with finite sizes.

Close to the transition temperature $T_c$, the adsorption transition
would have scaling behavior. It is easy to derive that the partition
function around the transition temperature also follows the scaling law,
\begin{equation}
\ln Z_N(\beta_0) \sim g(\tau N^{\phi}) \,
\end{equation}
in which $\tau=(\beta_0-\beta_c)/\beta_c$, and $\phi$ is the crossover
exponents.  This kind of scaling is rationally assumed to be also valid
around the real axis in
the complex plane. For the equation $Z(\beta)=0$, the root has to satisfy
the relation that $\tau N^{\phi}$ is invariant considering the scaling
behavior. This gives out the trend of the zeros as
$\beta_0-\beta_c \sim N^{-\phi}$ in the complex plane when the zeros are
close to the real axis. Therefore, the
transition temperature $T_c$ and the critical exponent $\phi$ could be
extrapolated based on this relation. This simple relation could help us to
find out the characteristics of phase transition at the thermodynamic limit
much more easily.

Besides, some other factors could be used
to characterized the phase transition, such as the factors $\gamma$ and
$\alpha$ in the reference \cite{WangJCP03}. The factor $\gamma=d \beta^R/d
\beta^I|_{\beta_0}$ (where $\beta^R$ and $\beta^I$ are the real and image
parts of the complex temperature corresponding to the roots of equation
$Z=0$) defines the slopes in the locus
of zeros to cut the real axis, and reflects the strength of the phase
transition. The factor $\alpha$ is related to the density $\rho$ of zeros on
the line toward real axis as the relation $\rho \sim (\beta^I)^{\alpha}$.
This factor could be used to judge the order of the phase transition.
For discrete zeros, these factors could be estimated with numerical
differentiations as $\gamma=(\beta_1^R-\beta_0^R)/(\beta^I_1-\beta^I_0)$,
$\alpha=(\ln \rho_1-\ln \rho_0)/(\ln\frac{\beta_2^I+\beta_1^I}{2}-
\ln\frac{\beta_1^I+\beta_0^I}{2})$, in which $\rho_i=1/|\beta_{i+1}-\beta_i|$,
and $|x|$ defines the norm
of the complex number $x$. More details could be referred to the reference
\cite{WangJCP03}.  Clearly,
these factors can be calculated from the zeros close to real axis.

%\section{Results and Discussions}

With the enumeration of the conformations, the DOS, $N(K)$, for the polymers
of various lengths ($L=8-24$)
are calculated (as shown in Fig.1). These DOS are normalized so that $N(K=L)=1$
for the full adsorbed state (which is fully extended aligned along the edge).
It is found that the DOS decreases roughly in an exponential manner. This
reflects the constraints of the rigid wall to the conformations, which
resembles an effective repulsion. The DOS $N(K=0)$ is generally the largest.
This is related to the translational entropy of the polymer molecules.
Therefore, $N(K=0)$ would be larger with little spatial constraints
(namely for the cases with larger $y_u$), while the other parts of $N(E)$
would not be changed by those parameters. Another feature of the DOS
is the shallow valley at $K=1$. This valley introduces a free-energy
gap between free state and the bound state. Therefore, a bimodal
population for the polymer (free or bound) could be expected, which
indicated the first-order-like character of adsorption transition.
However, the ratio of the states in the valley to all the adsorbed states
decreases gradually accompanying with the increase of chain length $L$ (as
shown in the inset of Fig.1).
It implies that the gap becomes shallower for longer chains. Thus,
the first-order-like feature of the transition would become weaker.
For the part $K>1$, the DOS decreases monotonically. This indicates
that the formation or growth of the contacts between the polymer and
the edge is not a sudden (or cooperative) process. This corresponds to
the feature of the second-order adsorption transition in the thermodynamic
limit. Accompanied with the decreasing effect of the adsorption initiation
at $K=1$ for long chains, the transition would behave more and more
second-order-like. This is qualitatively consistent with the previous
studies \cite{PCCP10,JCP09,JCP09b}.

The partition function zeros of the polymers with various lengths are
calculated with PLOY algorithm (using the program Scilab). Since the
coefficients of the equation $Z(s)=0$ are all real, the roots generally
form the conjugate pairs except the real roots. In these solutions of
$\beta$, there are no positive real roots for all partition functions.
This kind of observation indicates
there are no phase transitions for the polymers with finite sizes. This is
consistent with the physics of the polymer system. The complex zeros $\beta$
for some chains with representative lengths are shown in Fig.2. They are
almost aligned in lines. The complex zero $\beta_S$ with the smallest image
component (namely the zero closest to the real axis) is generally approaching
toward the real axis following the increase of the chain length. When the
length increases to the infinite (namely $L\rightarrow\infty$), this kind of
zeros would reach the real axis to produce a phase transition, namely the
adsorption transition. The related complex zeros ($\beta_S$) for the
polymers with various lengths are collected (as shown in Fig.3(a)). These
points approach to the real axis gradually following the increase of the
length. Based on the above discussions about partition function zeros, these
zeros would have a scaling behavior when they are close to their limit. For their
real and image components $\beta_S^R$ and $\beta_S^I$, the trends would have
the forms,
\begin{eqnarray}
\beta_S^R - \beta_c  &\sim&  L^{-\phi} \, , \\
\beta_S^I  &\sim&  L^{-\phi} \, ,
\end{eqnarray}
Here,
$\beta_c$ defines the limit of the zero $\beta_S(L)$ in real axis, which
is related to the critical temperature of adsorption transition. Therefore,
the critical crossover exponent $\phi$ could be determined easily through
the linear fitting for the log-log plot of the relation between the image
part $\beta_S^I$ of zeros and
the chain length $L$ (as shown in Fig.3(b)). It is worth noting that the
scaling would be valid when the length is large enough. To avoid the deviation
of the chains with small sizes, the fitting procedure is carried out for the
chains with their lengths larger than $20$. The corresponding exponent
$\phi=0.50658 \pm 0.00379$. This is consistent with previous theoretical
results\cite{PRL95}.
With this exponent, the collapse transition
temperature $T_c$ could be determined through the linear fitting for the
relation between the real part $\beta_S^R$ of zeros and the scaled length
$L^{-\phi}$ (as shown in Fig.3(c)). The resultant $\beta_c=0.47732 \pm 0.00322$
and the corresponding critical temperature of adsorption transition is
$T_c=2.095 \pm 0.014$.

The factors $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ are also important quantities
to characterize the transitions. They could also be determined for
each size of polymer chain. These factors are shown in Fig.4(a) and (b).
The $\gamma$ increases gradually following the increase of the chain
length. This indicates a large span of the transition region, and implies
the weakening of first-order feature in adsorption of polymers for
loner chains. More interestingly, the factor $\alpha$ are all negative.
This reflects that the adsorption transition for the investigated chains
are all first-order-like. This is consistent with previous simulation
results \cite{PCCP10,JCP09,JCP09b}.
It is worth noting that the variation of the factor $\alpha$ is
not monotonically following the increase of the polymer length.
For short chains, the absolute value of the factor $\alpha$ is apparently
smaller than the systematic trend toward the thermodynamic limit.
This could be attributed to the finite size effect, and is consistent with
the adsorption of monomer to the surface. Following the increase of the
length $L$, the effect of free-energy gap becomes more remarkable. Thus,
the value of $\alpha$ increase. This effect becomes important at $L=11$ to
$13$ for present model polymers. For even long chains, the effect of
free-energy gap is reduced gradually. A weak oscillation of $\alpha$
is observed. The similar phenomena are also observed previously\cite{JCP10b},
which is ascribed to the difference of chains with odd or even number of
monomers in lattice space. It could be expected that the
transition would become the second-order-like for the polymers with
sufficient lengths, which is out of the scale of the present study.
These results establishes a comprehensive picture for the size effect
of the adsorption transition of polymers.


%\section{Conclusion}

The method of partition function zeros provides a unique way to analyze various
aspects of the phase transition. In this work, the adsorption transition of
the homopolymer is systematically studied. Accompanied with the knowledge
of the length scaling, the transition temperature, critical crossover
exponent, and the order of the transition are determined. This method is
efficient and precise with no statistical errors. This work demonstrates
the power of the method with partition function zeros. This method could
be further applied to other systems with more complexity.
