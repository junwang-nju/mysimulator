\section{Introduction}

Polymer is a kind of system with many complex phase transitions
\cite{LifshitzRMP78}, such as the collapse transition\cite{FloryJCP49,
FloryBOOK67,WilliamsARPC81}, the glass transition\cite{GibbsJCP58,
JackleRPP86}, and so on. These transitions generally are the results
of the interplay between the complex interaction and conformational
entropy, and have attracted a lot of physical interests
\cite{LifshitzRMP78,FloryJCP49,FloryBOOK67,WilliamsARPC81,GibbsJCP58,
JackleRPP86,deGennesBook79,StephenPLA75,RigByJCP1987,BellRMP93,
ChengARMR,PrivmanBook81,ZivPCCP09,ChengBook08,xx,xx,physrep}.

The adsorption transition of a single homopolymer to a certain interface
is a typical and fundamental example of the transitions in polymeric
systems\cite{LifshitzRMP78,
FloryBOOK67,deGennesBook79,ZivPCCP09,ChengBook08,physrep}.
At the high temperature or having a weak attraction with the interface,
a homopolymer would be free with globule-like conformations. This kind
of state (or phase) has large conformational and translational entropy.
Differently, at low temperatures or with a strong attraction, the polymer
chain would be adsorp on the interface with a relatively extended
conformations. These conformations are generally the results of the
nonspecific attractive interactions between monomers and the surface.
The transition between the free and the adsorped states of homopolymers
following the changes of temperatures or affnity to the interface is
defined as the adsorption transition. The transition condition generally
marks the balance of the energy and the entropy of the system.
The adsorption transition have been studied for a long time with theoretical
and computational methods
\cite{deGennesBook79,PrivmanBook81,ZivPCCP09,SaleurJSP86,
DuplantierPRL87,StanleyPRB89,BinderBook95,OYJCP08,CaparicaCPC09,
BinderBook10,physrep,xx}, and has become the basic problem in polymer
physics\cite{LifshitzRMP78,deGennesBook79,ZivPCCP09,ChengBook08}
and other interdiscipline studies (such as peptide adhesion and so on).

Recently, complex phase structures are observed in variou kinds studies.
Especially, the size-dependent cooperativity in the adsorption processes
are pointed out in several works. For short polymer chains, the transition
would be first-order-like, while for rather long chains, the transition
would behave asymptotically towards the classical second-order transitions.
The transition feature could also affected by the external perturbations.
The finite-size effect of the adsorption transition would be an interesting
direction, and may be helpful for a deeper comprehension for the
interface-related biological and engineering phenomena. 


In the computational studies on the phase transitions in polymer
systems, the two-dimensional lattice model with exclusive volume effect is
one of the most popular models due to its simplicity. Both exact
enumerations and Monte Carlo simulations are used in the related
studies\cite{SaleurJSP86,DuplantierPRL87,StanleyPRB89,OYJCP08,
DerridaJPA85,SenoJP88,ChangPRE93,HeegerJP95,MurthyPRE01}. Some 
results could be obtained precisely with few statistical errors.
In this work, we employ the method of partition function zeros
to analyze the adsorption transitions of two-dimensional  model
polymers to an adhesive edge in square lattice. Full enumerations
of the conformations enables a precise dertermination of various
physical quantities. The size effect of the order of transitions,
the transition temperature, as well as the asymptotic exponent are
determined. These results give out a systematic characterization
of the adsorption transition for 2-d lattice polymers.

%\section{Models and Methods}

%\subsection{Lattice models of polymers}

The lattice polymer is modeled as a two-dimensional self-avoided chain
on the square lattice. The length $L$ is defined as the number of the
monomers in the chain. For this kind of model of polymers, the position
of the monomer $i$ is ${\mathbf r}_i=(x_i,y_i)$ relative to the presumed
origin, where $x_i$ and $y_i$ are integers. The bonds of chain connect
the monomers with the neighboring indeices and have the length of unit,
namely $|{\mathbf r}_{i+1}-{\mathbf r}_i|=1$. The exclusive volume effect
prohibites the overlaps of the chain, that is, there are no monomers sharing
the same coordinates, ${\mathbf r}_i\neq {\mathbf r}_j$ for $i\neq j$. 
As a simplification, there are no interactions between monomers, which
describes the condition of good solvent.

The adsorption interface is minimcked with an edge in 2-d cases. The edge
is located at the position $y_e=-1$. All the monomers cannot penetrate
over the edge, that is, $y_i>y_e$ is required due to the exclusive
effect. The monomers neighboring to the edge (namely $y_i=0$) would have
an energy gain $\epsilon>0$ as the attraction. This kind of interaction
corresponds to the cases with short-range attractive interactions.
As a result, the Hamiltonian
of the system thus takes the form,
\begin{equation}
{\mathcal H}=-\sum_i \epsilon \delta(y_i)\Theta(y_i) =-\epsilon K \, ,
\end{equation}
where the function $\delta(x)=1$ when $x=0$ and zero otherwise, the
function $\Theta(x)=1$ when $x\ge 0$ and is infinite otherwise, and the
integer $K$ is the number of contacts with the edge, which marks the
energy level of system. Generally, the quantity $\epsilon$ is picked 
as the unit of energy, namely $\epsilon=1$.
To keep the system with a constant concentration, a fixed boundary
is located as the position $y_u$. In this work, we take $y_u=30$
which is apparently larger than the size of polymers, and would
not introduce unexpected boundary effects. 
It is worth pointing out that the complex arrangement of the polymer
in the interface is suppressed for the two-dimensional cases. This
avoids the complexity related to the crystalization of polymer on
the interface, and helps us concentrate into the the adsorption
transition.

For this kind of interaction, the partition function of the system would be 
expressed as a polynomial,
\begin{equation}
Z=\sum_{K=0}^{K_{\text{max}}} \Omega(K) s^K \, ,
\end{equation}
where the quantity $s=exp(\epsilon/T)=exp(\beta\epsilon)$, $\Omega(K)$ is
the dentisty of states (DOS) of the system ans records the number 
of conformations on the energy level $K$ and $K_{\text{max}}$ is the
maximum of the index $K$. When the DOS is obtained, the partition function
and the related thermodynamic functions could be determined easily.

In this work, the DOS of the lattice polymers with various lengths are
determined with enumerations. Practically, a conformation is represented
as a string of directions. All the direction strings are enumerated.
Due to the existence of the edge, these conformations are moved along
the $y$ direction. Only the conformations not overlapping with the edges
are recorded. It is worth noting the conformations which share a same
direction string after the rotation and/or reflection operations are not
regarded as the same conformation since the bounday eliminates the
symmetry of the system, which is different from theprevious lattice
enumerations \cite{CieplakPRL98,PandePRL96}.

%\subsection{Partition Function Zeros}

The zeros of partition function $Z$ are defined as the roots $\beta=1/T$
for the equation $Z(\beta)=\sum_E n(E)e^{-\beta E}$ in the complex plane.
These roots are declared to be tightly related to the phase transition
of the system described with the partition function $Z$ by Yang and Lee
\cite{LYPR52}, and Fisher\cite{FisherBook}. This offers a powerful method
to determine the properties of the phase transitions, and has been used
in critical phenomena\cite{LipowskiIJMPB05}, the helix-coil transition
\cite{HansmannPRL00,HansmannPA01}, and the folding transition of
proteins and heteropolymers\cite{WangJCP03,ChenPA05}.
In this work, we apply this method to investigate
the collapse transition of homopolymer systems.

Clearly, when $\beta=\beta_c=1/T_c$ is a root of the equation $Z(\beta)=0$, all
the thermodynamic potentials would be divergent at the temperature $T_c$. When
$T_c$ is a positive real number, this kind of divergence indicates a phase
transition with the discontinuity of thermodynamic potentiaks. For the systems
with finite size, there are generally no real roots for the equation $Z=0$.
If the locus of the zeros close to the real axis could intersect with the
real axis when $N\rightarrow\infty$, the system would have a phase transition
at the thermodynamic limit. Therefore, the zeros close to the real axis and
the trends of the zeros to approach to the real axis would bring us a lot of
information about the transitions. This establishes a paradigm to analysis
the phase transition based on the models woth finite sizes.

Close to the transition temperature $T_c$, the adsorption transition
would have scaling behavior. It is easy to derive that the partition
function around the transition temperature also follows the scaling law,
\begin{equation}
\ln Z_N(\beta) \sim g(\tau N^{\phi}) \,
\end{equation}
in which $\tau=(\beta-\beta_c)/\beta_c$, and $\phi$ is the crossover
exponents.  This kind of scaling is rationally assumed to be also valid
around the real axis in
the complex plane. For the equation $Z(\beta)=0$, the root has to satisfy
the relation that $\tau N^{\phi}$ is invariant considering the scaling
behavior. This gives out the trend of the zeros as 
$\beta-\beta_c \sim N^{-\phi}$ in the complex plane when the zeros are
close to the real axis. Therefore, the
transtion temperature $T_{\theta}$ and the critical exponent $\phi$ could be
extrapolated based on this relation. This simple relation could help us to
find out the characteristics of phase transition at the thermodynamic limit
much more easily.

Besides, based on sophisticated derivation, some other factors could be used
to characterized the phase transition, such as the factors $\gamma$ and
$\alpha$ in the reference \cite{WangJCP03}. The factor $\gamma=d R_T/d I_T$
(where $R_T$ and $I_T$ are the real and image parts of the complex temperature
corresponding to the roots of equation $Z=0$) defines the slopes in the locus
of zeros to cut the real axis, and reflects the strength of the phase
transition. The factor $\alpha$ is related to the density $\rho$ of zeros on
the line toward real axis as the relation $\rho \sim I_T^{\alpha}$. This
factor could be used to judge the order of the phase transition. Clearly,
these factors can be calculated from the zeros close to real axis.

Practically, for a system with only discrete energy levels, the partition
function could be
re-formulated as a polynomial $Z(s)=\sum_J n(J) s^J$ where the variable
$s=exp(-\beta\epsilon)$ and $J=E/\epsilon$. Here $\epsilon$ should be carefully
selected so that the quantity $J=E/\epsilon$ is an integer for all the energy
$E$. For discrete energy levels, $\epsilon$ is generally possible, such as
taking the value of the minimal scale in energy measurements. In this case, the
original equation could be transformed as the problem to solve the polynomial
equation $Z(s)=0$, which would be easy to implement. The resultant solutions
of $\beta$ could be obtained with the transformation $\beta=-\ln s/\epsilon$.
The precise determination of the zeros may avoid the fluctuations of physical
quantities with other methods (such as Monte Carlo simulations).

%\section{Results and Discussions}

The DOS, $N(K)$, for the polymers of various lengths ($L=12-31$)
are given in Fig.1. These DOS are normalized so that $N(K=L)=1$
for the full adsorped state (which is fully extended aligned along the edge).
It is found that the DOS decreases roughly in an expnential manner. This
reflects the constraints of the rigid wall to the conformations, which
resembles an effective repulsion. The DOS $N(K=0)$ is generally the largest.
This is related to the translational entropy of the polymer molecules.
Therefore, $N(K=0)$ would be larger with little spatial constraints
(namely for the cases with larger $y_u$), while the other parts of $N(E)$
would not be changed by those parameters. Another feature of the DOS
is the shallow valley at $K=1$. This valley introduces a free-energy
gap between free state and the bound state. Therefore, a two-state
population for the polymer (free or bound) could be expected.

The DOS generally takes a concave shape in the region with a large $K$. This
feature ensures the existence of the collapse transition. It is worth noting
that the difference of $K$ between the most conpact conformations (with the
largest $K$) and the most probable conformations (often swollen with the $K$
around the peak of $P(E)$) becomes larger accompanying with the increase of
chain length $N$. The increase of the energetic difference between the
collapsed and the swollen conformations suggests the enhancement of the
cooperativity for longer chains. This indicates that there is a phase
transition when the length of the chain approaches to infinite, and reflects
the trend toward thermodynamic limit.

The zeros of the partition functions of the polymers with various lengths are
calculated with PLOY algorithm (using Scilab). Since the coefficients of the
equation $Z(s)=0$ are all real, the roots generally form the conjugate pairs
except the real roots. In these solutions of $\beta$, there are no positive
real roots for all partition functions. This kind of observation indicates
there are no phase transitions for the polymers with finite sizes. This is
consistent with the physics of the polymer system. The complex zeros $\beta$
for some chains with representative lengths are shown in Fig.2. They are
almost aligned in lines. The complex zero $\beta_S$ with the smallest image
component (namely the zero closest to the real axis) is generally approaching
toward the real axis following the increase of the chain length. When the
length increases to the infinite (namely $L\rightarrow\infty$), this kind of
zeros would reach the real axis to produce a phase transition. Physically,
this transition would be the collapse transition of the polymer system. The
line of $\beta_S(L)$ contains a lot of information about the phase transition.
Presently, the line $\beta_S(L)$ is estimated with the calculated $\beta_S$
for some chains of finite size. The related complex zeros ($\beta_S$) for the
polymers with various lengths are collected (as shown in Fig.3(a)). These
points approach to the real axis gradually following the increase of the
length. Based on the dicussion in Section ``Model and Method'', these zeros
would have a scaling behavior when they are close to their limit. For their
real and image components $\beta_S^R$ and $\beta_S^I$, the trends would have
the forms,
\begin{eqnarray}
\beta_S^R - \beta_{\theta}  &\sim&  L^{-\phi} \, , \\
\beta_S^I  &\sim&  L^{-\phi} \, ,
\end{eqnarray}
Here,
$\beta_{\theta}$ defines the limit of the zero $\beta(L)$ in real axis, which
is related to the collapse transition temperature. Therefore, the critical
exponent $\phi$ could be determined easily through the linear fitting for the
log-log plot of the relation between the image part $\beta_S^I$ of zeros and
the chain length $L$ (as shown in Fig.3(b)). It is worth noting that the
scaling would be valid when the length is large enough. To avoid the deviation
of the chains with small sizes, the fitting procedure is carried out for the
chains with their lengths larger than $20$. The corresponding exponent
$\phi=0.567 \pm 0.014$. With this exponent, the collapse transition temperature
$T_{\theta}$ could be determined through the linear fitting for the relation
between the real part $\beta_S^R$ of zeros and the scaled length $L^{-\phi}$
(as shown in Fig.3(c)). The resultant $\beta_{\theta}=xx \pm xx$ and the
corresponding collapse transition temperature is $T_{\theta}=xxx \pm xx$.

The exponent $\alpha$ is another important quantity related to the transition.
It could also be determined with the similar procedure to that for the
exponent $\phi$. This exponent is related to the local density of zeros close
to real axis, $\rho_S$. Practically, this density is estimated with a
three-point approximation,
\begin{equation}
\rho_S=\frac{2}{|\beta_0-\beta_1|+|\beta_1-\beta_2|} \, ,
\end{equation}
in which $|x|$ gives the norm of the complex number $x$, and the factors
$\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, and $\beta_2$ are indexed with increasing image parts of
the $\beta$. Clearly, the factor $\rho_S$ here is an estimation for the desity
of zeros around real axis based on the discrete zeros. When the length of the
polymer increases approaches to infinity, this quantity would converge to
the expect density related to the thermodynamic limit. Based on the analysis
in the section ``Model and Method'', the density $\rho_S$ would also have a
scaling behavior when the system is close to the thermodynamic limit. The
exponent could be obtained by the fitting procedure similar to the above
calculations. Practically, the fitting is carried out for the chains $N\ge
20$. The resultant exponent $\alpha=xxx$. Clearly, this exponent is obviously
larger than zero. This result indicates that this transition is a second-order
phase transition. This is consistent with the conclusions obtained from other
studies.

Previously, the transition temperature of lattice polymers on square lattice
was estimated as $1.31$\cite{JP82}, $1.55$\cite{BirshteinPolymer85} or
$1.505$\cite{OYJCP08} with Monte Carlo simulations. Their maximal lengths of
simulated polymers are $1.60$, $200$, and $300$. Similar to the calculations
of the transition temperature, the critical exponent $\phi$ is also diverse in
varius works, such as $0.6$\cite{BirshteinPolymer85} with Monte Carlo
simulations, $0.48$\cite{SaleurJSP86} with transfer matrix, and
$0.435$\cite{HeegerJP95} with growth method. Our result is in between
these results. Clearly, our results have no numerical errors for the zeros
related to the polymers with various lengths. It is reasonable that there are
statistical errors in our results. More importantly, the image parts of zeros
help us to determine the exponent more precisely since there are no shift
parameters during fitting. Differently, the processing of the simlation
results related to Monte Carlo simulations may have some artifacts in
parameter fitting. Therefore, our results would probably match the
case in thermodynamic limit. This also demonstrates the power of the method
with partition function zeros.

\section{Conclusion}

The method partition function zeros provides a unique way to analyze various
aspects of the phase transition. In this work, the collpase transition of the
homopolymer is systematically studied. Accompanied with the knowledge of the
length scaling, the transition temperature, critical exponent, and the order
of the transition at the thermodynamic limit are determined. Comparing with
previous results, this method is efficient and precise with no statistical
errors. This work demonstrates the power of the method with partition function
zeros. This method could be further applied to other systems with more
complexity.
