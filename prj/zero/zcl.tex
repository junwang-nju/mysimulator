\section{Introduction}

Polymer is a kind of soft condensed-matter system with many
complex phase transitions \cite{LifshitzRMP78,PrivmanBook81,
deGennesBook79,PhysRep},such as the collapse
transition\cite{FloryJCP49, FloryBOOK67,WilliamsARPC81,OYJCP08},
the glass transition\cite{GibbsJCP58, JackleRPP86}, and so on.
These transitions generally are the results of the interplay
between the complex interaction and conformational entropy, and
have attracted a lot of physical interests
\cite{LifshitzRMP78,FloryJCP49,FloryBOOK67,WilliamsARPC81,GibbsJCP58,
JackleRPP86,deGennesBook79,StephenPLA75,RigByJCP1987,BellRMP93,
PrivmanBook81,ZivPCCP09,PCCP10,JCP09,JCP09b,JCP10,
PRL95,PhysRep,OYJCP08,BinderBook95}.

The adsorption transition of a homopolymer through the
interaction with an interface is a typical and fundamental
example of phase transitions in polymeric
systems\cite{LifshitzRMP78,deGennesBook79,PhysRep, PCCP10,
JCP09,JCP09b,JCP10,PRL95,BinderBook95}. It is related to the
competition between translation entropy of the molecule and the
adsoption affinity of the interface. The connectivity of the
polymer would also affect this kind of processes. With the help
of powerful simulation skills, the complex phase structures
related to adsorption are outlined\cite{PCCP10,
JCP09,JCP09b,JCP10,JCP08,Pull09}. Especially, the transition
between a short free polymer and its bound state is observed to
be first-order-like, which is different from the
phase-transition feature in thermodynamic limit with scaling
analysis. This kind of finite-size effect is unusual. Is this
phenomenon an artifact related to the selection of the reaction
coordinates in the simulations? What are the physical factors to
produce such a kind of first-order-like transition and the
related conversion of transitions? Would the asymptotic behavior
for longer chains be affected by this kind of unusual behavior
of adsorption? The answers to these questions would not only be
helpful to understand the underlying physics of adsorption
transitions of polymers, but also be suggestive to analyse the
adsorptions of various chemical and biological polymers with
finite sizes.

In this work, we employ the method of partition function zeros
to analyze the adsorption transitions of a series of
two-dimensional model polymers to an adhesive edge on the square
lattice. Full enumerations of the conformations enables a
precise determination of various physical quantities. The
partition function zeros in the complex temperature plane are
determined for various size of chains. The asymptotic behavior
of transition temperatures is analyzed and, thus, the crossover
exponent is obtained. The finite-size effect of the orders and
strengths of the transitions is also discussed based on the
information of zeros. The first-order-like feature is confirmed.
Based on the bond correlation, the variation of the features of
phase transtions are qualitatively explained with a two-level
model. These results give out a systematic characterization of
the adsorption transition for 2-dlattice polymers.

%\section{Models and Methods}

%\subsection{Lattice models of polymers}

The lattice polymer is modeled as a two-dimensional self-avoided
chain on the square lattice. This model is popular and simple to
studythe physics of polymer systems. The length $L$ is defined
as the number of the monomers in the chain. For this model of
polymers, the position of the monomer $i$ is ${\mathbf
r}_i=(x_i,y_i)$ relative to the presumed origin, where $x_i$ and
$y_i$ are integers. The bonds of chain connect the monomers with
the neighboring indices and have the length of unit, namely
$|{\mathbf r}_{i+1}-{\mathbf r}_i|=1$. The exclusive volume
effect prohibits the overlaps of the chain, that is, there are
no monomers sharing the same coordinates, ${\mathbf r}_i\neq
{\mathbf r}_j$ for $i\neq j$. As a simplification, there are no
interactions between monomers, which describes the condition of
good solvent.

The adsorption interface is mimicked with an edge in 2-d case.
The edge is located at the position $y_e=-1$. All the monomers
cannot penetrate over the edge, that is, $y_i>y_e$ is required
due to the exclusive volume effect. The monomers neighboring to
the edge (namely $y_i=0$) would have an energy gain
$-\epsilon<0$ as the attraction. This kind of interaction
corresponds to the cases with short-range attractions. Thus, the
Hamiltonian of the system thus takes the form, ${\mathcal
H}=-\sum_i \epsilon \delta(y_i)\Theta(y_i) =-\epsilon K$, where
the function $\delta(x)=1$ when $x=0$ and is zero otherwise, the
function $\Theta(x)=1$ when $x\ge 0$ and is infinite otherwise,
and the integer $K$ is the number of contacts with the edge ,
which marks the energy level of system. Generally, the quantity
$\epsilon$ is picked as the unit of energy, namely $\epsilon=1$.
To keep the system with a finite concentration, a fixed
boundaryis located as the position $y_u$. In this work, we take
$y_u=30$which is apparently larger than the size of polymers,
and would not introduce unexpected boundary effects. It is worth
pointing out that the complex arrangement of the polymer in the
interface is suppressed for the 2-d cases, which avoids the
complexity related to the crystallization of polymer on the
interface, and helps us concentrate into the adsorption
transition.

For this kind of interaction, the partition function of the
system would be expressed as a polynomial of $s$,
$Z=\sum_{K=0}^{K_{\text{max}}} \Omega(K) s^K$ where the quantity
$s=\exp(\epsilon/T)=\exp(\beta\epsilon)$, $\Omega(K)$ is the
density of states (DOS) of the system and records the numberof
conformations on the energy level $K$ and $K_{\text{max}}$ is
the maximum of the index $K$. When the DOS is obtained, the
partition function and the related thermodynamic functions could
be determined easily and precisely.

In this work, the DOS of the lattice polymers of various sizes
are determined with enumerations. Practically, a conformation is
represented as a string of directions. All the direction strings
are enumerated. Due to the existence of the edge, shift
operations along the $y$ direction are used to generate all
possible conformations. Only the conformations without overlap
with the edges are recorded. It is worth noting the
conformations which share a same direction string after the
rotation, reflection and/or translation operations are not
regarded as the same conformation since the boundary eliminates
the symmetry of the system, which is different from the previous
lattice enumerations \cite{CieplakPRL98,PandePRL96}.

%\subsection{Partition Function Zeros}

The zeros of partition function $Z$ are the roots $\beta_i=1/T$
for the equation $Z(\beta)=\sum_E n(E)e^{-\beta E}=0$ in the
complex plane. Here the index $i$ is assigned based on the
distances of the zeros away from the real axis (generally in
upper or lower complex plane respectively). For the systems with
discrete levels, the equation $Z(s)=0$ would become a polynomial
equation, and is easy to solve. The expected solutions of
$\beta$ could be obtained with the transformation $\beta=-\ln
s/\epsilon$. These roots are tightly related to the phase
transition of the system described with the partition function
$Z$ \cite{LYPR52,FisherBook}. This method does not depend on the
choice of reaction coordinates, and offers a powerful tool to
determine the properties of the phase transitions, and has been
used in many investigations for phase
transitions\cite{LipowskiIJMPB05,JCP10b,
HansmannPRL00,HansmannPA01,WangJCP03,ChenPA05}. In this work,
this method is applied in the analysis for the adsorption
transition of homopolymer systems.

Among all these zeros, the zeros $\beta_0$ close to the real
axis and the trends of the zeros to approach to the real axis
would bring us a lot of information about the transitions. For
example, based on the scaling analysis, the zero $\beta_0$ would
have the scaling behavior when close to the transition
temperature, $\beta_0-\beta_c\sim N^{-\phi}$. Here, $\phi$ is
the crossover exponent. The analysis of the zeros $\beta_0$
provides a systematical way to deduce transition temperature and
crossover exponent. Besides, some other factors for the
characterization of phase transitions, such as the factors
$\gamma$ and $\alpha$ in the reference \cite{WangJCP03}, could
also be calculated with the zeros. Here, the factor $\gamma=d
\beta^R/d \beta^I|_{\beta_0}$ (where $\beta^R$ and $\beta^I$ are
the real and image parts of the complex temperature
corresponding to the roots of equation $Z=0$) defines the slopes
in the locus of zeros to cut the real axis, and reflects the
strength of the phase transition. The factor $\alpha$ is related
to the density $\rho$ of zeros on the line toward real axis as
the relation $\rho \sim (\beta^I)^{\alpha}$, and could be used
to judge the order of the phase transition. For discrete zeros,
these factors could be estimated with numerical differentiations
as $\gamma=(\beta_1^R-\beta_0^R)/(\beta^I_1-\beta^I_0)$,
$\alpha=(\ln \rho_1-\ln
\rho_0)/(\ln\frac{\beta_2^I+\beta_1^I}{2}-
\ln\frac{\beta_1^I+\beta_0^I}{2})$, in which
$\rho_i=1/|\beta_{i+1}-\beta_i|$, and $|x|$ defines the norm of
the complex number $x$. Details could be referred to the
reference \cite{WangJCP03}. These establish the paradigm to
analysis phase transitions through the complex zeros $\beta$ of
partition functions.

%\section{Results and Discussions}

With the enumeration of the conformations, the DOS, $N(K)$, for
the polymers of various lengths ($L=8-24$) are calculated (as
shown in Fig.1). These DOS are normalized so that $N(L)=1$ for
the full adsorbed state (which is fully extended and aligned
along the edge). It is found that the DOS decreases roughly in
an exponential manner. This reflects the constraints of the
rigid wall to the conformations, which resembles an effective
repulsion. The DOS $N(0)$ is generally the largest. This is
related to the translational entropy of the polymer molecules.
Therefore, $N(0)$ would be larger with little spatial
constraints (namely for the cases with larger $y_u$), while the
other parts of $N(K)$ would not be changed by those parameters.
Another feature of the DOS is the shallow valley at $K=1$. This
valley introduces a free-energy gap between free state and the
bound state. Therefore, a bimodalpopulation for the polymer
(free or bound) could be expected, which indicated the
first-order-like character of adsorption transition. However,
the ratio of the states in the valley to all the adsorbed states
decreases gradually accompanying with the increase of chain
length $L$ (as shown in the inset of Fig.1). It implies that the
gap becomes shallower for longer chains. Thus, the
first-order-like feature of the transition would become weaker.
For the part $K>1$, the DOS decreases monotonically. This
indicates that the formation or growth of the contacts between
the polymer and the edge is not a sudden (or cooperative)
process. This corresponds to the feature of the second-order
adsorption transition in the thermodynamic limit. Accompanied
with the weaker effect of the adsorption initiation at $K=1$ for
longer chains, the transition would behave more and more
second-order-like. This is qualitatively consistent with the
previous studies \cite{PCCP10,JCP09,JCP09b}.

With these DOS, the partition function zeros of the polymers
with various lengths are calculated with PLOY algorithm (using
the program Scilab). The complex zeros $\beta$ for some chains
with representative lengths are shown in Fig.2. They are almost
aligned in lines. The complex zeros close to real axis
($\beta_0$) for the polymers of various lengths are collected
(as shown in Fig.3(a)). These points approach to the real axis
gradually following the increase of the length. Based on the
above discussions about partition function zeros, the real and
image components $\beta_0^R$ and $\beta_0^I$, have the trends,
$\beta_0^R - \beta_c \sim L^{-\phi}$ and $\beta_0^I \sim
L^{-\phi}$. Here, $\beta_c$ defines the limit of the zero
$\beta_0(L)$ in real axis, and represents the critical
temperature of adsorption transition. Thus, the critical
crossover exponent $\phi$ could be determined easily through the
linear fitting for the log-log plot of the relation between the
image part $\beta_0^I$ of zeros and the chain length $L$ (as
shown in Fig.3(b)). It is worth noting that the scaling would be
valid when the length is large enough. To avoid the deviation of
the chains with small sizes, the fitting procedure is carried
out for the chains with their lengths larger than $20$. The
corresponding exponent $\phi=0.50658 \pm 0.00379$. This is
consistent with previous theoretical results\cite{PRL95}. With
this exponent, the transition temperature $T_c$ could be
determined through the linear fitting for the relation between
the real part $\beta_0^R$ of zeros and the scaled length
$L^{-\phi}$ (as shown in Fig.3(c)). The resultant
$\beta_c=0.47732 \pm 0.00322$ and the corresponding critical
temperature of adsorption transition is $T_c=2.095 \pm 0.014$.
From these asymptotic behaviors, there are no signals for the
conversion of the types of phase transitions.

The factors $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ are also important quantities
to characterize the transitions. They could be determined for
each size of polymer chain. These factors are shown in Fig.4(a)
and (b). The $\gamma$ increases gradually following the increase
of the chain length. This indicates a large span of the
transition region, and implies the weakening of first-order
feature in adsorption of polymers for loner chains. More
interestingly, the factor $\alpha$ are all negative. This
reflects that the adsorption transition for the investigated
chains are all first-order-like. This is consistent with
previous simulation results \cite{PCCP10,JCP09,JCP09b}. It is
worth noting that the variation of the factor $\alpha$ is not
monotonically following the increase of the polymer length. For
short chains, the absolute value of the factor $\alpha$ is
apparently smaller than the systematic trend toward the
thermodynamic limit. Following the increase of the length $L$,
the effect of free-energy gap becomes more remarkable. Thus, the
value of $\alpha$ increase. This effect becomes important at
$L=11$ to $13$ for present model polymers. For even long chains,
the factor $\alpha$ is reduced gradually. This kind of
variations of transition feature may be related to the local
rigidity of polymers. As shown in Fig.4(c), the bond correlation
function $C_{\parallel}(d)=\sum_k
\delta(b_k)\delta(b_{k+d})/\sum_k \delta(b_k)$ for $L=18$ goes from a large
value approaching the average value $0.25$. For other chains,
the correlation is similar. This function
describes the correlation of bonds to be aligned parallel to the
edge. For $d\le 3$, the correlation is larger than the average
probability considering exclusive volume $\frac{1}{3}$. This
indicates that the local bonds are not irrelevant and would
prefer to take the conformations straightly aligned on the edge.
Therefore, the neighboring $5$ residues are correlated and may
have a cooperative adsorption with the edge. When the chain is
short enough, the local cooperative binding may sufficiently
stabilize the adsorption of the whole chain, and produce the
first-order-like transitions. Differently, for longer chain, the
local interaction is not enough to produce the whole adsorption.
The growth of more adsorbed sites from local binding processes
would be gradual and the finally transition would be in
second-order manner. To further illustrate this picture, the
average energies $\langle E\rangle$ are calculated at the
transition temperature $1/\beta_0$. This kind of energy measures
the strength to produce adsorption. It is foundthat the $\langle
E\rangle$ is smaller than $5$ for the chains with their lengths
smaller than $13$. This implies that the local binding is
sufficient to help the adsorption of the whole chain for the
chains of the lengths $L\le 13$. The adsorption of these chains
would be expected to be cooperative. While for longer chains,
the feature of second-order transition would appear gradually.
This is consistent with the results from the analysis of factor
$\alpha$, and illustrates the basic source of first-order-like
feature and the size-dependent conversion of transitions.
Besides, A weak oscillation of $\alpha$ is observed. The similar
phenomena are also observed previously\cite{JCP10b}, which is
ascribed to the difference of chains with odd or even number of
monomers in lattice space. These results establishes a
comprehensive picture for the size effect of the adsorption
transition of polymers.


%\section{Conclusion}

As a conclusion, the method of partition function zeros provides
a unique way to analyze various aspects of the phase transition.
In this work, the adsorption transition of the homopolymer is
systematically studied. Accompanied with the knowledge of the
length scaling, the transition temperature, critical crossover
exponent, and the order of the transition are determined. This
method is efficient and precise with no statistical errors. This
work demonstrates the power of the method with partition
function zeros. This method could be further applied to other
systems with more complexity.
