\section{Introduction}

Polymer is a kind of system with many complex phase transitions
\cite{LifshitzRMP78}, such as the collapse transition\cite{FloryJCP49,
FloryBOOK67,WilliamsARPC81}, the glass transition\cite{GibbsJCP58,JackleRPP86}, and
so on. These transitions generally are the results of the interplay
between the complex interaction and conformation entropy, and have
attracted a lot of physical interests\cite{LifshitzRMP78,FloryJCP49,
FloryBOOK67,WilliamsARPC81,GibbsJCP58,JackleRPP86,deGennesBook79,
StephenPLA75,RigByJCP1987,BellRMP93,ChengARMR,PrivmanBook81,ZivPCCP09,
ChengBook08}.

The collapse transition of homopolymers is a typical and fundamental
example of the transitions in polymeric systems\cite{LifshitzRMP78,
FloryBOOK67,deGennesBook79,ZivPCCP09,ChengBook08}. In good solvent
regime or at the high temperature, a homopolymer would have swollen
conformations with large gyration radii. This kind of state (or phase)
has large conformational entropy. Differently, in the poor solvent
regime or at low temperatures, the polymer chain would take compact
conformations. These conformations are generally the results of the
nonspecific attractive interactions between monomers. The transition
between the swollen and the compact states of homopolymers following
the changes of solvent condition or temperatures is defined as the
collapse transition. The transition condition generally marks the
balance of the energy and the entropy of the homopolymer, and the
corresponding transition temperature is historically called theta
temperature, or Flory temperature $T_{\theta}$\cite{FloryJCP49}.
The collapse transition and the related critical exponents have been
studied for a long time with theoretical and computational methods
\cite{deGennesBook79,PrivmanBook81,ZivPCCP09,SaleurJSP86,
DuplantierPRL87,StanleyPRB89,BinderBook95,OYJCP08,CaparicaCPC09,
BinderBook10}, and has become the basic problem in polymer physics
\cite{LifshitzRMP78,deGennesBook79,ZivPCCP09,ChengBook08}.

In the computational studies on the collapse transition, the
two-dimensional lattice model with exclusive volume effect is
one of the most popular models due to its simplicity. Both exact
enumerations and Monte Carlo simulations are used in the related
studies\cite{SaleurJSP86,DuplantierPRL87,StanleyPRB89,OYJCP08,
DerridaJPA85,SenoJP88,ChangPRE93,HeegerJP95,MurthyPRE01}. The
transition temperature and the critical exponents related to the
collapse transition are evaluated with this kind of lattice models.
However, the results from various calculations are diverse
quantitatively. For example, the transition temperature varies from
$1.31$ to $1.55$ on the square lattice, and the crossover exponent
$\phi$ is estimated to be in the region between $0.419$ and $0.86$.
These differences are apparently larger than the computational
errors. This may be partially attributed to the finite-size effect
and the errors during the evaluations of the concerned physical
quantities. It is expected to have a precise calculation for the
features of the collapse transition. The analysis of the collapse
transition is still a non-trivial work, and the results and methods
would be valuable to understand various transitions in more
complicated polymeric systems (such as proteins\cite{ZivPCCP09}).

In this work, the order of the transition, the transition temperature
and the related crossover exponent are determined based on the analysis
using the partition function zeros of the two-dimensional models
on square lattice. In detail, the exact partition function zeros are
determined for the chains with the length from $12$ up to $31$. Based
on the asymptotical trends of the locations of the zeros (especially
of the zeros around real axis), the transition temperature and the
crossover exponent are determined with high precisions. These results
gives out the precise characteristics of the collapse transitions of
two-dimensional lattice polymers, and demonstrates the power of the
method with partition function zeros.

\section{Models and Methods}

\subsection{Lattice models of polymers}

The lattice polymer is modeled as a two-dimensional self-avoided chain
on the square lattice. The length $L$ is defined as the number of the
monomers in the chain. For this kind of model of polymers, the position
of the monomer $i$ is ${\mathbf r}_i=(x_i,y_i)$ relative to the presumed
origin, where $x_i$ and $y_i$ are integers. The bonds of chain connect
the monomers with the neighboring indeices and have the length of unit,
namely $|{\mathbf r}_{i+1}-{\mathbf r}_i|=1$. The exclusive volume effect
prohibites the overlaps of the chain, that is, there are no monomers sharing
the same coordinates, ${\mathbf r}_i\neq {\mathbf r}_j$ for $i\neq j$. 

To consider the hydrophobic interaction between the monomers, the spatially
neighboring monomers which are not connected by a bond would have an
attractive interaction with the strength $\epsilon>0$. The Hamiltonian of
the polymer thus takes the form,
\begin{equation}
{\mathcal H}=-\sum_{i<j-1}\epsilon \Delta(|{\mathbf r}_i-{\mathbf r}_j|)=
-\epsilon K \, ,
\end{equation}
in which $\Delta(D)=1$ when $D=1$, and zero otherwise, and the integer $K$
is the number of the contacts between monomers and marks the energy level
that the concerned conformation belongs to. Therefore, the partition
function of the polymer would be written as a polynomial,
\begin{equation}
Z=\sum_{K=0}^{K_{\text{max}}} \Omega(K) s^K \, ,
\end{equation}
where the quantity $s=exp(\epsilon/T)=exp(\beta\epsilon)$, $\Omega(K)$ is
the dentisty of states (DOS) of the system ans records the number 
of conformations on the energy level $K$ and $K_{\text{max}}$ is the
maximum of the index $K$. When the DOS is obtained, the partition function
and the related thermodynamic functions could be determined easily.

In this work, the DOS of the lattice polymers with various lengths are
determined with enumerations. Practically, a conformation is represented
as a string of directions. All the direction strings are enumerated. It is
worth noting the conformations which share a same direction string after
rotation and/or reflection operations are regarded as the same conformation.
This kind of operation has been widely used in lattice enumerations
\cite{CieplakPRL98,PandePRL96}.

\subsection{Partition Function Zeros}

The zeros of partition function $Z$ are defined as the roots $\beta=1/T$
for the equation $Z(\beta)=\sum_E n(E)e^{-\beta E}$ in the complex plane.
These roots are declared to be tightly related to the phase transition
of the system described with the partition function $Z$ by Yang and Lee
\cite{LYPR52}, and Fisher\cite{FisherBook}. This offers a powerful method
to determine the properties of the phase transitions, and has been used
in critical phenomena\cite{LipowskiIJMPB05}, the helix-coil transition
\cite{HansmannPRL00,HansmannPA01}, and the folding transition of
proteins and heteropolymers\cite{WangJCP03,ChenPA05}.
In this work, we apply this method to investigate
the collapse transition of homopolymer systems.

Clearly, when $\beta=\beta_c=1/T_c$ is a root of the equation $Z(\beta)=0$, all
the thermodynamic potentials would be divergent at the temperature $T_c$. When
$T_c$ is a positive real number, this kind of divergence indicates a phase
transition with the discontinuity of thermodynamic potentiaks. For the systems
with finite size, there are generally no real roots for the equation $Z=0$.
If the locus of the zeros close to the real axis could intersect with the
real axis when $N\rightarrow\infty$, the system would have a phase transition
at the thermodynamic limit. Therefore, the zeros close to the real axis and
the trends of the zeros to approach to the real axis would bring us a lot of
information about the transitions. This establishes a paradigm to analysis
the phase transition based on the models woth finite sizes.

Close to the transition temperature $T_{\theta}$, the collapse transition
would have scaling behavior. It is easy to derive that the partition
function around the transition temperature also follows the scaling law,
\begin{equation}
\ln Z_N(\beta) \sim N^{-(\alpha+2)\phi} g(\tau N^{\phi}) \,
\end{equation}
in which $\tau=(\beta-\beta_{\theta})/\beta_{\theta}$, and $\alpha$ and
$\phi$ are the concerned critical exponents. The definition of the function
$g(x)$ could be refer to the references\cite{ChangPRE93}. This kind of
scaling is rationally assumed to be also valid around the real axis in
the complex plane. For the equation $Z(\beta)=0$, the root has to satisfy
the relation that $\tau N^{\phi}$ is invariant considering the scaling
behavior. This gives out the trend of the zeros as 
$\beta-\beta_c \sim N^{-\phi}$ in the complex plane when the zeros are
close to the real axis. Therefore, the
transtion temperature $T_{\theta}$ and the critical exponent $\phi$ could be
extrapolated based on this relation. This simple relation could help us to
find out the characteristics of phase transition at the thermodynamic limit
much more easily.

Besides, based on sophisticated derivation, some other factors could be used
to characterized the phase transition, such as the factors $\gamma$ and
$\alpha$ in the reference \cite{WangJCP03}. The factor $\gamma=d R_T/d I_T$
(where $R_T$ and $I_T$ are the real and image parts of the complex temperature
corresponding to the roots of equation $Z=0$) defines the slopes in the locus
of zeros to cut the real axis, and reflects the strength of the phase
transition. The factor $\alpha$ is related to the density $\rho$ of zeros on the line
toward real axis as the relation $\rho \sim I_T^{\alpha}$. This factor could
be used to judge the order of the phase transition. Clearly, these factors can
be calculated from the zeros close to real axis.

Practically, for a system with only discrete energy levels, the partition
function could be
re-formulated as a polynomial $Z(s)=\sum_J n(J) s^J$ where the variable
$s=exp(-\beta\epsilon)$ and $J=E/\epsilon$. Here $\epsilon$ should be carefully
selected so that the quantity $J=E/\epsilon$ is an integer for all the energy
$E$. For discrete energy levels, $\epsilon$ is generally possible, such as
taking the value of the minimal scale in energy measurements. In this case, the
original equation could be transformed as the problem to solve the polynomial
equation $Z(s)=0$, which would be easy to implement. The resultant solutions
of $\beta$ could be obtained with the transformation $\beta=-\ln s/\epsilon$.
The precise determination of the zeros may avoid the fluctuations of physical
quantities with other methods (such as Monte Carlo simulations).

\section{Results and Discussions}

The normalized DOS, $P(E)=N(E)/\sum_E N(E)$, for the polymers of various
lengths ($N=12-31$) are given in \textcolor{red}{Fig.1(a)}. The total
numbers $N=\sum_E N(E)$ for the chains with various lengths are listed
in the Table I.
It is found that the DOS has a peak with a small number $K$ of
contacts, and then decreases repaidly when $K$ increases. The DOS generally
takes a concave shape in the region with large $K$. This feature ensures the
existence of the collapse transition. The heat capacities at various
temperatures are also calculated (as shown in Fig.1(b)). Folowing the increase
of chain length, the transition becomes more cooperative with higher peaks and
narrower dispersions for the heat capacities. This reflects the trends toward
the thermodynamic limit.

The zeros of the partition functions of the polymers with various lengths are
calculated with PLOY algorithm (using Scilab). Since the coefficients of the
equation $Z(s)=0$ are all real, the roots generally form the conjugate pairs
except the real roots. There are no positive real roots for all partition
functions, which indicates there are strict phase transition for the polymers
with finite sizes. The complex zeros for some represnetative chains are shown
in Fig.2. They are almost aligned in lines. The complex zero with the largest
real component (which is generally positive) is generally approaching toward
the real axis following the increase of the chain length. This zero is related
to the collapse transitions (marked as TZ) and would be investigated with more
attentions. This kind of complex zeros (TZ) for various polymers are collected
(as shown in Fig.3(a)). These points approach to the real axis gradually.
Based on the dicussion in Section ``Model and Method'', these zeros would
have a scaling behavior when close to their limit. For their real and image
components $R_{TZ}$ and $I_{TZ}$, the trends would have the forms,
$R_{TZ}-R_{\theta} \sim N^{-\phi}$ and $I_{TZ} \sim N^{-\phi}$. Here,
$R_{\theta}$ defines the limit of zeros in real axis, which is related to the
transition temperature. Therefore, the critical exponent $\phi$ could be
determined easily by the linear fitting for the log-log plot of the relation
between the image part $I_{TZ}$ of zeros and the chain length $N$ (as shown in
Fig.3(b)). To avoid the deviation of the chains with small sizes, the fitting
is carried out for the chains with their lengths larger than $xx$. The
corresponding exponent $\phi=xx \pm xx$. With this exponent, the transition
temperature $T_{\theta}$ could be determined through the linear fitting for
the relation between the real part $R_{TZ}$ of zeros and the scaled length
$N^{-\phi}$ (as shown in Fig.3(c)). The resultant $R_{\theta}=xx \pm xx$ and
the corresponding transition temperature is $T_{\theta}=xxx \pm xx$.

The exponent $\alpha$ is also determined with the similar procedure. The local
density of zeros around real axis is calculated with the middle-point
approximation. The fitting is carried out for the chains $N\ge 20$. The
resultant $\alpha=xxx$. Clearly, this exponent is larger than zero. THis
indicates that this transition is a second-order transition, which is
consistent with the conclusions from previous stidues.

Comparing with the previous studies, our transition temperature is rather
similar to that with transfer matrix, and has a smaller error comparing with
other results with Monte Carlo simulations. 

\section{Conclusion}

The method partition function zeros provides an unique way to analyze various
aspects of the phase transition. In this work, the collpase transition of the
homopolymer is systematically studied. Accompanied with the knowledge of the
length scaling, the transition temperature, critical exponent, and the order
of the transition at the thermodynamic limit are determined. Comparing with
previous results, this method is efficient and precise with few statistical
errors. This work demonstrates the power of the method with partition function
zeros. This method could be further applied to other systems with more
complexity.
