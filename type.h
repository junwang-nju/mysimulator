 * @brief type.h
 * @brief Declaration for basic types for my package
 *
 * Here I just introduce some header files for types used in my packages.
 * Some manual declarations of generic types could also be included in
 * this file.
 *
 * @todo Considering basic types are defined in different headers for
 *       various platforms and compilers. We need to define some macro
 *       conditions to match platform or compiler
